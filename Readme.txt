Project Description

This project revolves around a database system that tracks various aspects of
basketball leagues, including sponsors, teams, revenue, and players. The domain of the
application is sports league management. The program will capture the interactions
between different entities within the league. It gives the user both a broad overview of
the current status of the league and detailed insights into player and team performance,
enabling cost and performance analysis to improve the overall quality of the league.
